 * sball_set_nullregion()

 * The null-region is the area (centered at 0) around which
 * each coordinate will report zero even when the Spaceball itself
 * reports a number whose absolute value is less than the null region
 * value for that coordinate.  For example, if the null region on the
 * X translation coordinate is set to 50, all sball_getstatus() would report
 * 0 if X is less than 50 and greater than -50.  If X is 51, sball_getstatus
 * would report 1.  If X is -51, sball_getstatus() would report -1.
 * Null-regions help novice users gradually become accustomed to the
 * incredible sensitivity of the Spaceball, and make some applications
 * significantly easier to control.  A resonable default nullregion for all
 * six axes is 65.  Null regions should be tunable by the user, since its
 * likely that not all Spaceballs are quite identical, and it is guaranteed
 * that users have varying levels of manual dexterity.
 * Note that setting the null-region too high significantly reduces the
 * dynamic range of the output values from the Spaceball.
