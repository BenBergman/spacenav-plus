# Do not use spacenav-plus
The mainline [spacenav project](https://github.com/FreeSpacenav) has reintroduced support for the serial spaceball devices and is being actively maintained, so there is no need for this repository any more.


# spacenav-plus
Mirror of spacenav-plus, a fork of spacenav that includes support for Magellan and Spaceball 5000 devices.
